# The Magic8ballApp

A Magic 8 Ball App you can ask to make all your difficult decisions! While developing this app, I applied the knowledge and skills I gained from creating my 'diceApp' and built an independent project that includes its own unique features and functionality. I hope you enjoy using this project and find it helpful in answering any questions you might ask it!
